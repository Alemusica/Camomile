#### Known Issues :
 - The VST3 plugin is limited to 14 channels due to the new channel management offered by Juce. We'll try to fix it later, but for the moment we suggest to use the VST2 plugin.
 - The names and the labels of the parameters shouldn't change after the plugin creation. Since the parameters depend on the patches and that the plugin loads the patches after its creation, some DAW don't display the name and the label in their own GUI.

### How to use the Camomile plugin:

1. Download the [plugin](https://github.com/pierreguillot/Camomile/releases).
2. Put the binaries in the standard plugins folder.
3. Open your DAW (ask to re-scan the plugins if needed).
4. Load the plugin in a track.
5. Click on the camomile flower.
6. Open one of the Pure Data patches given with the binaries.
7. Create your own Camomile patch... it is very easy, follow the next section.

### How to create a patch for the Camomile plugin:

* Use the *adc~* and the *dac~* objects to receive and send the signal from the plugin. The maximum number of inputs and outputs supported is 16 but it should be enough for most of the applications.

* Add a label, the first word is the name of the parameter and the second word is the label of the parameter, and a receive symbol to a GUI object to create a parameter. The minimum and maximum values will be used for the range of the parameter.

* Add only a receive symbol to a GUI object if you want to use it as a second interfaces to control a parameter. It can be useful if you want to associate a slider with a numbox for example.

* Activate the  "Graph-On-Parent" option in your patch as and use the size and the offset to define the visible area of the patch. If you want your GUIs or comments to be visible, you must place them in this area.

> You should always ensure that the send and receive symbols are specifics to the patch instance by using *$0*.
