Camomile is a dynamic Plugin that allows to load and control [Pure Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) patches  
inside a digital audio workstation. Camomile translates the [Cream](https://github.com/CICM/CreamLibrary) library's user  
graphical interfaces into [Juce](http://www.juce.com) component for creating a modular plugin editor  
and retrieves the parameters of this graphical objects in order to associate them  
with the plugin host.
