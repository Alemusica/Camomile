**Camomile is a dynamic plugin made with [Juce](http://www.juce.com) that allows to load and to control [Pure Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) patches inside a digital audio workstation.**

### Compilation
The cross-platform dependencies (libPd, Pure Data, JUCE and the VST SDK), are integrated as submodules to the repository. You need to pull the repository and its submodules:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pierreguillot/Camomile.git  
cd Camomile
```

#### MacOS
To compile the AU, AUv3, VST & VST3 plugins on MacOS, you first need to compile the static version of libPd for multi instances and multi threads. The static library is expected to be in the folder **./libpd/libs**.  Thereafter, you can compile the Camomile plugins. There two options:
- **Manual**  

For the first step, you can compile the **libpd-osx-multi** from the project **libpd.xcodeproj** located in the **./libpd** folder (don't forget to change the destination folder). Then you can compile all the targets of the the project **Camomile.xcodeproj** located in **./Builds/MacOSX**.
 At the root of this directory, you can run the two following commands

- **Command Line**

```
xcodebuild -project libpd/libpd.xcodeproj -target libpd-osx-multi -configuration Release ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR="./libs" | egrep -A 5 "(error|warning):"
xcodebuild -project Builds/MacOSX/Camomile.xcodeproj -configuration Release | egrep -A 5 "(error|warning):"
```

If you want to modify the Camomile project, you should use **Camomile.jucer** with the Juce's projucer application. If you want to compile the Audio Unit, after generating the XCode project, you must change the type of the **include_juce_audio_plugin_client_AU.r** located in the folder **JuceLibraryCode** to **Objective-C++ preprocessor**.

#### Linux
JUCE requires
```
sudo apt-get -qq update
sudo apt-get install -y -qq libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev python-dev libfreetype6-dev libgtk-3-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev alsa libasound2-dev ppa:webkit-team/ppa libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37 libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
```
