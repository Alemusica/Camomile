    //! Instance should be created with a name. The Instance has some kind of smart
    //! pointer behavior so when no Instance uses a t_pdinstance anymore the
    //! t_pdinstance is deleted. For the moment, several Instance can share the same
    //! name, but to ensure future compatibilty you should give a different name to
    //! all specifics Instances.
